# Switching Wallets for Remaining Contracts

## ✅ Recovery Successful
I have recovered the address of the **HealthLink** contract deployed by your previous wallet:
- **Address**: `0x4F20aFa5552f3FE609296567527979F143aBEc86`
- **Status**: Deployed & Ready

To save gas, we will reuse this contract and only deploy the remaining ones.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Provide Private Key**: Please provide the private key for the NEW wallet you want to use.
2. **Deploy Remaining**: I will deploy:
   - PatientRecords
   - Appointments
   - Prescriptions
   - DoctorCredentials
3. **Link Contracts**: I'll ensure all contracts are correctly linked and addresses are saved.

Please share the private key when ready!
